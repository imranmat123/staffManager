During this coursework, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of software design and programming principles. I learned the importance of using interfaces and classes to create well-organized, modular code that is easier to maintain and update. Additionally, I gained insight into the importance of defensive programming, which involves anticipating and handling potential errors or bugs in code, in order to prevent them from causing larger issues down the line.

The use of the Collections framework was also a key aspect of this project, which allowed me to efficiently manage and manipulate large sets of data. I was able to implement various collection classes, such as HashMaps, to store and retrieve academic staff data.

One of the highlights of this project was gaining experience in implementing appropriate overriding of Object class methods. This allowed me to customize the behavior of certain methods, such as toString and equals, to better suit the needs of the academic staff data management system.

In addition, the project also required me to implement factories to control object instantiation and the Singleton pattern, which allowed me to create efficient and reliable code for instantiating and managing objects.

Throughout the development process, I also gained a deeper understanding of the importance of proper documentation and testing techniques. Writing clear and concise comments and documentation helps ensure that others can easily understand and maintain the code in the future. Additionally, rigorous testing ensures that the code works as intended and catches any potential bugs or errors before they can cause larger issues.

Overall, this coursework provided me with a valuable opportunity to not only enhance my skills and knowledge in software development but also to apply them to a real-world project. I am proud of the work I completed and the skills I gained through this experience.
